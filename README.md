### Create a new branch.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory of your local Git repository.

It's a good practice to start from the main branch or the branch you want to base your new branch on. You can switch to the main branch using:
To create a new branch, use the following command:

git checkout -b new-branch-name


You can verify that you are now on the new branch by using:

git branch


Now that you're on the new branch, you can make changes to your code, add new files, or perform any other tasks specific to your development.


Commit Changes:

After making changes, commit them to the new branch:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"



 Push the New Branch to GitHub (Optional):


 If you want to push your new branch to GitHub to collaborate or back up your work, use:

 git push origin new-branch-name


This command pushes the new branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

Now, you have successfully created a new branch, switched to it, and made some changes. You can continue working on this branch and switch between branches as needed.
